# BubblePop

This is a simple game of agility where the user attempts to pop bubbles floating thruogh the air before they hit the ground.

## Gameplay
Bubbles will appear at a regular interval and the player can attempt to pop them. Smaller bubbles are worth more points while larger bubbles are worth less. If a bubble falls to the bottom of the screen and pops against the ground it counts as negative points. For negative points, though, smaller bubbles are worth less negative points than larger bubbles.

Each round is 30 seconds and the player attempts to score as many points as possible during the round. The top 10 high scores are recorded on a leader board.

The player can also adjust the "speed" of the game via a slider at the top of the game. This changes 3 things:
1. The speed at which the bubbles fall.
2. The amount of "turbulance" there is that will blow the bubbles around instead of letting them fall straight down.
3. The frequency at which bubbles appear.
Increasing the speed allows the user to potentially score more points because the bubbles come faster. However, if too many bubbles are missed the negative points incurred can counteract those potential gains.
